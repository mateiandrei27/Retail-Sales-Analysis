## 8. Limitations & Future Work  
- Data is historical (2022–2023), not real-time.  
- Lacks geographical segmentation (cannot assess regional performance).  
- Profit and margin analyses can be expanded with product-level granularity.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Integrate sales with CRM data for customer segmentation (RFM analysis).  
- Develop **interactive dashboards (Power BI / Tableau)** for management reporting.  
- Explore **predictive analytics** (forecasting sales by category and month).
